Hi John,

the Binder connectors are IP67 rated which is absolutely water sealed for
outisde environment. Even temporary immersion in water up to 3ft is allowed
for this protection grade.
Therefore, I would rather believe the joint between cable stump and
supporting cable may have become leaky. We seal those joints with heat
shrink tube with inboard hot glue to achieve good sealing.

Also, as the short circuit did not appear on the connector itself speaks
against a leaky connecor. The short circuit would have affected the cable
directly at the connector end then.

As there is a hole in the cable it is likeley that water distributed over
the cable so water may be found at the connector as well as some feet away
in the cable.

If water reached the connector, it may have shortened Vcc against the debug
pins which gives word why the DSPs have been affected.

I would ask you have all cable ends checked. Maybe it is a better solution
to directly connect your cable to the Binder connectors to eliminate the
cable joint. This thought should be taken into consideration for the PAWS
installation as well.

As said before, we exchange the DSP boards of the three UMRR units. The
hardware is almost identical but has additional drivers for the debug pins.
Future repairs on hardware of this project may be connected to repair cost.

Planned shipment date for the repaired & tested hardware is tomorrow. I'll
tell you the tracking number as soon as it becomes available.

Betreff: Re: AW: Status of the Radars

Hi Bernd:

I checked with the technician who did the wiring on the radars, and he 
told me that he wired only four wires to pins on the female connector: 
green and yellow carry the signal, and blue and red carry power.

Now, I have some new information. The cable to ID1 burned. The 
insulation on the wires carrying power melted. I am sending some 
pictures of the cable end. The technician told me that when he 
disconnected the cable from ID1 and let it hang down, that water drained 
out of the connector. He also said there was no power coming into the 
connector; after cutting off the cable end, he measured ~13 VDC on the 
severed power wires. I have attached some pictures of the cable end, 
which has been cut from the rest of the cable.

Cable6.jpg is a picture of the cable end. I am holding the cable and 
pointing to two features with my index fingers. With my right index 
finger I am pointing to the burned power wires; with my left index 
finger I am pointing to a burn hole in the outer insulation. Other 
pictures contain close-up pictures of these two features. In Cable5.jpg, 
it is apparent that the power wires have burned, that the outer shield 
is discolored from the burned insulation, and that the green and yellow 
signal wires are not affected. Cable3 is a close-up of the connector, 
showing some greenish oxidation around pins 6, 5, 8, and 2.

My conclusion is that water from rain got into the connector and shorted 
the power wires, causing the insulation to burn and the wires to break. 
How could this have affected the CAN or DSP chips?
